# orinfar

a text editor for witches

# Principles

## Minimal

- Tui applications are ideal for my workflow
- Should be anything the user wants from a basic plaintext editor to a fullscale ide

## Extendible

- Ideally by a robust scripting language (neovim fails in this regard)
- The language should:
  - Have a robust typesystem
  - Be as fast as possible
  - Be comprehensible (such that a user with reasonble experience poke around in their editor config)

## Reliable

- Not much else to say at the moment
