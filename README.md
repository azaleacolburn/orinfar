# orinfar

a text editor for witches

# Principles

## Minimal

- A TUI application
- Should be a simple but powerful, opinionated text editor
- Something similar to base vi, but with better defaults (lsp support, etc)
- Perhaps something more minimal but principly similar to [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/)

## Reliable

- Not much else to say at the moment

# Roadmap

I'll specify and revise this list when I get around to specific things and I have a better understanding of where I want to take this project

- [x] Basic Vi commands (w, b, o, d, etc)
- [ ] Additionally Vi features (a robust register system, marks, etc)
- [ ] Lsp support, syntax highlighting, etc
