# orinfar

a text editor for witches

# Principles

## Minimal

- A TUI text editor
- Simple but powerful and opinionated
- Not configurable
- Similar to base vi, but with better defaults (lsp support, etc)
- Similar in princible to [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/), but more minimal

## Reliable

- Ideally, all software should work exactly as documented and intented
    - No implementation quirks
    - No undocumented but "obvious" or "intuitive" behavior
- Not much else to say at the moment

# User Manual
Please read the [user manual](https://github.com/azaleacolburn/orinfar/tree/main/docs/MANUAL.md) before trying to edit text with Orinfar. While this text editor is mostly a subset of Vi, there are subtle differences.

# Implementation

# Roadmap

I'll specify and revise this list when I get around to specific things and I have a better understanding of where I want to take this project

- [x] Basic Vi commands (w, b, o, d, etc)
- [ ] Additionally Vi features (a robust register system, marks, etc)
- [ ] Lsp support, syntax highlighting, etc

# Known Bugs
Please check the [stable](/tree/stable)  for the latest bug-free commit
